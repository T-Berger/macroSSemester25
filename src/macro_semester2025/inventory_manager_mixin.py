Inventory System with Mixins and Polymorphism

This exercise will guide you through building a flexible inventory system
using abstract base classes, mixins, multiple inheritance, and polymorphism.

Steps:

1. Create Mixins:
   - Discountable Mixin:
     - Define a class named `Discountable`.
     - Implement a method `apply_discount(percent)` that takes a percentage and reduces the item's price by that percentage.

   - Trackable Mixin:
     - Define a class named `Trackable`.
     - Implement a method `move_to(location)` that takes a location string and assigns it to the item.

2. Create Concrete Item Classes:
   - Book Class:
     - Define a class named `Book` that inherits from both `PhysicalProduct` and `Discountable`.
     - Ensure it initializes with properties like name, price, quantity, and shipping cost per unit.

   - Electronics Class:
     - Define a class named `Electronics` that inherits from both `PhysicalProduct` and `Trackable`.
     - Ensure it initializes with properties like name, price, quantity, and shipping cost per unit.

3. Expand the Inventory Class:
   - Apply Discounts:
     - Add a method `apply_discounts(percent)` to the `Inventory` class.
     - Iterate over all items in the inventory and apply the discount to items that have the `apply_discount` method.

   - Move Items:
     - Add a method `move_items(location)` to the `Inventory` class.
     - Iterate over all items in the inventory and move items that have the `move_to` method to the specified location.

4. Demonstrate Functionality in the `__main__` Section:
   - Create Instances:
     - Create an instance of `Book` with a name, price, quantity, and shipping cost per unit.
     - Create an instance of `Electronics` with a name, price, quantity, and shipping cost per unit.

   - Add to Inventory:
     - Create an instance of `Inventory`.
     - Add the `Book` and `Electronics` instances to the inventory.

   - Apply Discounts and Move Items:
     - Call the `apply_discounts` method on the inventory with a discount percentage (e.g., 10%).
     - Call the `move_items` method on the inventory with a location string (e.g., "Warehouse A").

   - Print Total Value:
     - Call the `get_value` method on the inventory to calculate the total value.
     - Print the total value of the inventory.
